# GosFrontline go program

This project is actually homework for Introduction to computers, 2024 fall. We are asked to write a program to host a go-like boardgame. The requirements are included together with the source code in this repo.

This program was written by Shane Xue (qq2198631773@outlook.com) and Yueming Ma.
